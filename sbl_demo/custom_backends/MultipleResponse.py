        """Facilitates generation of multiple response fields. These are fields within
        the SBL Fig denoted "Field type: Multiple response." The set of codes to sample
        from, per sample length distribution, and whether duplicates are allowed must
        all be set. The only one that does not contain default values is the list of
        codes. Depending on the use case of the mock data, these codes could be valid,
        invalid, or a combination thereof.

        For example, `MultipleResponse(codes=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` will
        create an engine that returns duplicate-free concatenations with 1 through
        5 elements. The default uniform distribution will cause each of these lengths
        to occur with approximately equal frequency. To make single selections more
        common than 4 and 5 selections, the distribution could be changed to a
        "right tail" distribution such as an exponential distribution.

        In order to generate records where certain values cannot be combined with any
        other record, supply codes to `single_selection_codes`. For example, if this is
        set to [977], 977 will not appear in a sample with other records. The frequency
        with which single selection codes appear is controled by the probability keyword
        `single_selection_probability`. This value should be between 0 and 1 and
        controls the proportion of samples that are single selections.

        Args:
            codes (List[int]): List of codes to sample from. These are all integers
                within SBL Multiple Response fields, but could theoretically be any
                object that is serializable. Do not include single selection codes in
                this list. Supply these to `single_selection_codes`.
            min_selections (int, optional): Minimum number of codes that will be sampled
                when generating mock data. Defaults to 1.
            max_selections (int, optional): Maximum number of codes that will be sampled
                when generating mock data. Defaults to 5.
            distribution (str, optional): Name of the scipy.stat's distribution from
                which the number of codes to sample is drawn. Defaults to "uniform".
            duplicates_allowed (bool, optional): If True, the generated samples may
                contain duplicate values. e.g. 1;1;2. Defaults to False.
            single_selection_codes (List[str], optional): A set of codes that can only
                appear by themselves.
            single_selection_probability (float, optional): Controls the proportion of
                generated samples that are drawn from the list of single selection
                codes. If set to 0.1, approximately 10% of generated samples will be
                one of the codes in `single_selection_codes`.
