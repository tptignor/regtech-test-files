"""This class is used to sample data from a continuous distribution. This class has
the functionality to sample from a distribution and appropriately shift and scale the
data to a particular range. For example, this class can be used to sample data from a 
normal distribution but place the data on the interval of [0, 100]. Scaling and shifting
is handled automatically. Any continuous distribution from scipy.stats can be used. See
Scipy's list of continuous distributions at:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#continuous-distributions

Only the name of the distribution should be supplied. Not the class itself. For example,
to use scipy.stats.norm as the underlying distribution, just pass distribution="norm"
and the class will utilize importlib to load the appropriate class. This approach is
taken becuase it simplifies generation of backends from properties listed within a 
yaml file. Otherwise, `distribution: norm` within a yaml file would need to be mapped
to the appropriate scipy class prior to calling the constructor for the backend class.
