        The specification (spec) is a mapping of field names to backends and backends

        dataset. The secondary key corresponds to the name of the backend that should
        be used for said field. All lower level keys are supplied to the constructor of
        the backend. For example, an `income` field could be defined as follows via
        yaml.

                distribution: norm
